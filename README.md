## Reduce Calories & Carbon at Once!
 **Echoet** is an android application help the people who want to **reduce their weight and carbon at the same time.**
It's contains fun animation, calories & carbon reduction graph, monthly sroceboard and so on.

## Motivated from
 According to World Energy Outlook 2015 of IEA(International Energy Agency), Korea's average CO emissions per capita in 2030 is 9.4 tons, It is predicted that it will be the **third largest in the world** after Russia and the United States.

 Like this, Korea needs to reduce CO emission. Eating well-being foods that do not require a cooking process, rather than cooked and fatty foods with high carbon emissions, is a way to practice environmental conservation. And this well-being foods are helpful to lose weight

 So we think the App that helps **Environmental protection and losing weight at once**, that name is ‘Echoet(Echo + Diet)’. If users input how much they had, 'Echoet' shows the amount of carbon, calories produced by their cooking process. By comparing this data with previous data, user can know how much he lose the weight, and we will show this data by animation and graph.
